# BoilerPlate

This is a React Boilerplate/Sandbox configured with Babel, Webpack and SASS.  
I mostly use it to test new ideas and components mechanics.  
It is also configured with Redux.  

#### Set Up . 

git clone the repo  
`npm i` 
`npm run build:`(`dev` || `prod`)  
you can also continue editing with the webpack development server:   
`npm run dev-server`  
The project run on port 8081. 

#### React expenses

This is adapted from a Udemy course. This is how i started learning about React and Redux.  
It is pretty basic though. I did not finish it since I learnt what I needed from this course. 

#### Calculus . 

I took the time to redo the exercice written by Samer Buna in his Medium Article :  
[Do you want to learn more about React? Let’s build — and then play — a game.](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/do-you-want-to-learn-more-about-react-lets-build-and-then-play-a-game-218e0da5be44)  

But my mom asked me to add multiplications in the game. So I had to change a little bit the game mechanics.   
Nothing really hard though.
I realy learned a lot through this exercice and it was very fun to do. Thank you Samer !
